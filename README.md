# incDataMigrationAzure

A simple data migration project developed using Azure services and visualised using Power BI. The focus was to use as many services possible for a start we have used only four Azure Services. For the project, a dataset with 5000 records from Maven Analytics Data Playground. The dataset contained information about each company on the INC 5000 list in 2019. We have used Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Gen2, Azure Databricks and Azure SQL Database for the migration pipeline.
